# KATARA-Microfluidics-Controller
The KATARA Microfluidics controller consists of a shield for Arduino Mega for driving 70 solenoid valves, a python package and GUI for controlling the arduino, and an arduino programs that recieves signals from the python package.

The printed circuit board designs are posted on EASYEDA:
